## The Atom JavaScript grammar 

This extension replaces the JavaScript grammar in Visual Studio Code with the JavaScript grammar from the Atom editor. 

This allows you to have the same syntax coloring experience as in Atom. The Atom grammar supports
variable and function reference highlighting, of course only if the currently active color theme colorizes these.

The original Atom JavaScript grammar is maintained at https://github.com/atom/language-javascript. Please file issue with the grammar against that repository. Requests for the extension (such as update requests) can be filed against the vscode repository.

### License
The extension is made available under the following [Microsoft Software License Terms](LICENSE.txt).

The grammar syntaxes/javascript.json was derived from grammars/javascript.cson in the 
Atom package https://github.com/atom/language-javascript.
